# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation
Takes in over 500,000 users and given the data in text files, comes up with a movie recommendation and rating for respective movies and users. The data structure I mainly used to solve this machine learning problem is HashMaps. It worked quite well because ArrayLists take far too long to loop through and make dynammic changes when looking over 2000 files and over 500K ratings.
